# 8. Database migrations

Almost all applications that need to persist data will end up using a database of some sort and in most cases MySQL or PostgreSQL. With this comes a database schema (or structure if you'd like) of tables and columns that is necessary for the application to store data it uses for certain tasks such as state or statistics. The process of dealing with changes to the database schema has often been dealt with manually where in best cases some sort of documentation or sequenced SQL files ending up in a repository for reference.

But now we have entered a new era of PHP application development and the tools for dealing with database changes are now modern and often built into frameworks. The most used term is *migrations* and in this chapter I will use the [Phinx](https://phinx.org/) as the weapon of choice for handling migrations.

The benefits are many and the two major ones are that you get versions of your database schema where each step either create, delete or manipulate tables or columns in the previous schema. You will get, if you don't manually change it, a chronological list of files that contains your database changes. Adding a new migration file along with your feature or fix you can make sure that the database gets updated or performs a rollback along with the code automatically, once you add this to your deploy process. Which migration files to run next or to rollback is stored in the database itself. There is also an added benefit of getting developers up and running when starting to develop on your application, you do not need to dump your database and import it or keep track of the structure in a separate file. Clone the repository and run the migrations and they should have a fully functional database to work with.

## 8.1 Installation & configuration

As always I recommend using Composer to install Phinx

    composer require robmorgan/phinx

This will install all dependencies and the Phinx binary at `vendor/bin/phinx`. So let's bootstrap a configuration file:

    php vendor/bin/phinx init

You can now find `phinx.yml` in the root directory of your project. Take a look inside it and set up your database credentials.

## 8.2 Migration files

Generating migration files is really easy, you run the command `php vendor/bin/phinx create NameOfYourMigration` and it will generate a file named `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_name_of_your_migration.php` in the `migrations/` folder unless you change this in the configuration file.

All migration will end up in files that extends `Phinx\Migration\AbstractMigration` and will initially consist of a `change()` method only. This is a behavior that was introduced in version *0.2.0* of Sphinx and I do not like it. The reason being that it introduces magic in our migrations by trying to guess how to revert changes and leaves you with no option of modifying that, also it only works with a certain set of operations. I prefer the old fashioned way of using `up()` and `down()` since it enables us to be flexible and I will in the next section continue my reasoning on this. So I always start with replacing the contents of my newly generated migration file with:

{lang="php"}
~~~
public function up()
{
    // Up changes goes here
}

public function down()
{
    // Down changes goes here
}
~~~

These two methods is where you put your intended changes to the database. `up()` will be the method for when you migrate and the `down()` method is used for reverting the changes you made in the `up()` method, this is to provide consistency in migrating and performing rollbacks. So in a case of creating a table for users when migrating, you would drop that table when performing a rollback.

We can now start to adding our changes to the migration file. Let's create that user table I've been going on and on about, it would look like this.

{lang=php,crop-start-line=7,crop-end-line=21}
<<(code/chapter-8/migrations/20150817080530_create_users_table.php)

A simple table with names `users` than contains string columns for e-mail and password that can't be null. It also adds a unique index for the e-mail column since our database should never be able to store multiple users with the same e-mail. When we revert this change we simply drop the table.

The valid column types that you can pass to `addColumn()` are:

* string
* text
* integer
* biginteger
* float
* decimal
* datetime
* timestamp
* time
* date
* binary
* boolean
* enum (MySQL only)
* set (MySQL only)
* json (Postgres only)
* uuid (Postgres only)

Along side these you can apply options to the column, such as we did with `null`, and they can be found in the Phinx documentation [here](http://docs.phinx.org/en/latest/migrations.html#valid-column-options).

At this point we realize we want to keep track of when each user was created, so we need a column for that in the user table. We first generate a new migration file:

    php vendor/bin/phinx create AddCreatedAtToUsersTable

We can now select our `users` table again and apply the changes we want and also provide a revert where we simply drop the column.

{lang=php,crop-start-line=7,crop-end-line=21}
<<(code/chapter-8/migrations/20150818081646_add_created_at_to_users_table.php)

## 8.3 Possible data loss on rollbacks

Something important to bear in mind when reverting changes is that you do not want to accidentally lose vital information. Say you implement a feature for users to pay for a subscription of some sort in your application and you create a column for storing a timestamp when their subscription expires. If you end up having to rollback this feature after a couple of days and your migration files just simply delete this column you could end up in a situation where you don't know how long a user should have their subscription.

To prevent this you can in your migration scripts either rename columns or tables instead of deleting them or you can copy the data to a temporary table or column. When the rollback is performed you can then manage the data manually since it will be outside of your automated changes to the table or column. More than often I do not encourage doing things manually but this is one occurrence where it really can not be dealt with in an automated way.

## 8.4 Batches

Your application will most likely not be deployed feature by feature, most likely it will be deployed release by release where each release contains one or more features. So a release could consist of more than one migration file, even a single feature could contain more than one. When you deploy and your deploy process automatically applies these changed it will take all the migration files that wasn't included in your latest release and run them against your database. All and well until you want to do a rollback when your latest deploy had multiple migration files because now it will only take the latest migration file and revert the changes in those. The chain of automation is now broken and we need a way of tracking the batches of migration files.

This example illustrates the problem:

```
├── Release #1
│ 20150817080530_create_users_table.php
│ 20150818081646_add_created_at_to_users_table.php
├── Release #2
│ 20150831053347_add_username_to_users_table.php
│ 20150831053404_add_unique_username_index_on_users_table.php
└──
```

After deploying our two releases we perform a rollback, our database will then be at the state of *20150831053347_add_username_to_users_table.php* since only the latest migration will be reverted. This puts our application and database out of sync unless someone manually performs another rollback on the database (this could also mean performing multiple rollbacks, one for each change). So we need a way of tracking our migrations as batches so we can pinpoint where we want our rollback to revert to. Unfortunately this is not something that Phinx provides for us and they have [a reason](https://github.com/robmorgan/phinx/issues/99) for it.

I have not found any good tools for dealing with these situations outside of frameworks. *Laravel* for example solves this by tracking the batch number inside its migrations database table and performs migrations and rollbacks based on that. What you need is a persistent storage for the latest migration version of each batch which can be in a file, in a database or in a cache layer. If you put it in a cache layer you need to make sure your cache layer is persistent and not only an in-memory cache. I've created a very simple class for dealing with persisting the batches to a file, nothing fancy and very prone to errors but its only purpose is to show how it can be dealt with. For example it can't accept any parameters to be passed to Phinx, it doesn't deal with any errors that might occur but instead it will only perform the necessary actions if the Phinx binary responds with an exit status of 0, which in Linux language means that everything is okay. You can take a look at the example, but *I urge you never to use it in production*.
