# Conclusion

Thank you so much for purchasing this book and reading it through to the end. This has been a very inspiring and rewarding experience for me, and I hope that you have enjoyed the book and learned things. If you did enjoy it I would appreciate if you spread the word about it. Tweet it, recommend it to friends, share the link, or perhaps talk about it at a meetup you are organizing, speaking at or just attending.

To my best ability I've tried to mix theory with practice. This kind of book would get long and boring if no applicable technical aspect were covered. That is why I covered deploy tools and tried to include code in different chapters, to balance it all out. 

I do not know when I will consider my work done on this book. I will continue to revise and add to it from time to time. Deploy tools is something I will continue adding for example. We all know how fast technology moves and I think it is important to try and keep up with it in this book. If you find anything that is outdated or something you find should be added to this book, don't hesitate to contact me.

Thanks again!
